Case Study: American Parkour

**Project Overview**
Over the past 8 years, Mark Toorock has grown American Parkour into the largest international community for parkour and freerunning. This health-focused startup successfully carries multiple business lines, from a physical gym to an online apparel store. The APK (American Parkour) team was ready to re-think their entire digital strategy, so they could focus on what they do best: promoting, teaching, and advancing parkour throughout the world to improve people's lives.

**My Role**
Mark brought me in as the director of interactive. My objective was to figure out why people were coming to APK, and then re-design the entire digital experience to: 

1. Get people started in parkour; 
2. Keep people coming back; 
3. Inspire people to share their learning experiences with others.

This involved a massive interdisciplinary effort. When I say "digital strategy", I mean every aspect of realizing an improved the online experience. I was responsible for the user experience design (product/IxD/Visual), content strategy, social media strategy, product management, front-end development, and back-end development with a variety of technologies (from Wordpress, Rails, and Shopify.)

**The Story: Part One, History**
This one's a doozy. 

APK and I have a long history. This history is important, as it establishes the context as to why I was given so much rope to play with when I started this project in late-2013. 

I was one of the members who helped start the company back in 2005. APK consisted of a message board with about 20 participants from around the country, and a simple blogging platform to share tips with fellow traceurs. I held similar responsibilities: anything digital/interactive. I helped grow the community to over 80,000 registered members, and helped lay the foundation for the apparel store, professional team, and parkour gym.

The web was a different beast back then. YouTube had just opened it's doors. Social media wasn't a thing. People still used <table>'s for designing layouts, and CSS 2.1 was still a working draft. Mobile (or responsive design) didn't exist.

Mid-2010, I had just graduated college and made the decision to leave the parkour world. Calling this decision "difficult" would be an understatement, but my heart was set on building a software design studio. Mark and I kept in touch, but I dove straight into the tech startup world, where life moved 100x faster than anywhere else.

**The Story: Part Two, Rekindling**
Fast-forward to the beginning of 2013. I was coming off a long-term contract, and parkour found it's way back into my life as I started training regularly. With a bit of free time on my hand, I reached out to Mark to see if I could lend a hand updating the site. We grabbed a burger together at Five Guys in downtown DC, and spent the entire night thinking through APK's focus and mission. The energy was intense, and the commitment to improvement was solid.

Mark took my advice, and begun the process of channeling his focus. Little tweaks here and there resulted in a more streamlined site, but it was a drop in the bucket. 

Half a year later, Mark asked what it would take to get me on-board to really overhaul what American Parkour was. Talk was talked, and the walk was negotiated. We had ourselves a deal.

**The Work**
We started with a discovery to lay out why we were doing this. It helped us pinpoint 4 distinct business lines that we were going to focus on.

1. Community site (content marketing)
2. Apparel store
3. APK Academy (the physical gym)
4. Digital products (subscriptions to tutorials; ebooks.)

We set the tone for APK's brand by working through dozens of visual iterations on the Community site.

The test-bed was a custom registration system for the gym. It had to display class descriptions, accept payments, send emails, and provide class/student information to administrators.

We then worked through the information architecture of the site, and devised a content strategy: the goal, tone, type of articles, and how we would share them across our vast network.

Once mapped out, we turned to years of data to see which pieces of the old site were the most important to update and reformat. The list was large, and we needed focus, so we cut down on items until we were at the bare minimum; our core essential pieces.
